Julia v1.12 Release Notes
========================

New language features
---------------------

Language changes
----------------

 - When methods are replaced with exactly equivalent ones, the old method is no
   longer deleted implicitly simultaneously, although the new method does take
   priority and become morespecific than the old method. Thus if the new method
   is deleted later, the old method will resume operating. This can be useful
   to mocking frameworks (such as has been seen in SparseArrays, Pluto,
   Mocking, among others), as they do not need to explicitly restore the old
   method. While inference and compilation still must be repeated with this, it
   also may pave the way for inference to be able to intelligently re-use the
   old results, once the new method is deleted. ([#TBD])
